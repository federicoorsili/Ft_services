General instructions
- Check if all the necessary configuration files of your application are in the folder srcs.
- Check if the setup.sh file is at the root of the repository.
- Execute "setup.sh"
 Yes  No
Mandatory part
This project consist of clusturing an application and deploying it with Kubernetes. Check if all the next points are respected. At the first error, you stop the correction and put a zero.
Services environment
- Verify if the application is deployed with all containers only with "setup.sh" script.
- Check using the dashboard if the evaluated has all the different containers.
They are nginx, ftps, wordpress, mysql, grafana and influxDB.
These containers must have the same name. If this is not the case or if a container is missing, the correction stops.
- Check if all containers are build with Alpine Linux. If not, the correction stops here.
- Also, check that each container has its Dockerfile, which was built using setup.sh.
The evaluated have to build himself the images that he will use. It is forbidden to take already build images
or use services like DockerHub.
If one is missing, or if one does not start with "FROM: alpine" or any other local image, the correction stops here.
 Yes  No
Expose it !
- Check that redirections to your services are done with a Load Balancer.
To do that use "kubectl get services":
ftps, grafana, nginx & wordpress must be "LoadBalancer" type and EXTERNAL-IP field cannot be 127.0.0.1 or end with .0 or .255.
influxdb & mysql must be "ClusterIP" type.
Other entry can appear, but none must be "NodePort" type.
Every EXTERNAL-IP must be the same.
Also, check that "setup.sh" file don't use any "kubectl port-forward" command.
 Yes  No
Nginx
- Try to access http (port 80) and verify that you are automatically redirected to https (port 443).
Then, execute the command "curl -I http://IP" and check if return code is a
"301 Moved Permanently" and the "Location" line is the same IP but in https.
Page displayed does not matter, as long it's not a web error (404, 503 etc).
SSL certificate are not necessarily recognized, certificate error on https is normal.
If one point listed previously differ, the correction stops.
 Yes  No
FTP(s) server
- Check if the FTPS server is listening on port 21. Make sure it is a FTPS server (s for secure)
and not a basic FTP server.
If the FTPS server does not work as it should, the correction stops here.
- Check if you can upload and download files without any errors.
 Yes  No
Hello Word(Press), MySQL and PhpMyAdmin
- Check if the WordPress website works under port 5050 on his IP. Connect to it using the administrator account,
check if several users is present, after leave a comment under post. Make sure your comment is added to the database entries.
For that, you can access PhpMyAdmin interface, must be under port 5000 on his IP and check the database ("wp_comments" table).
The database must persist in case failure.
To test this, you can remove the MySQL container with the Kubernetes dashboard.
It must recreate itself automatically, after check if your comment is still in the database.
If something does not work as expected, the correction stops here.
 Yes  No
Grafana and InfluxDB
- Check if grafana is running under port 3000 on his IP. Connect to the interface.
You have to check if grafana is monitoring all containers. To do that search for the dashboard list,
click on the dashboards one by one.
Like MySQL database, after deleting the InfluxDB container, check that the data prior to deletion is still present in Grafana.
If something does not work as expected, the correction stops here.
 Yes  No
Persistence!
- Check that in the event of a crash/shutdown of one of the services, the associated container relaunches correctly.
To do this, use "kubectl exec deploy/SERVICE -- pkill APP" (replacing SERVICE and APP of course).
Stop web containers (usually nginx or php-fpm APP) and stop grafana APP for this same container.
Stop the ftps server (usually vsftpd APP).
Stop mysqld and influxd APP for corresponding databases (recheck if the data persists).
If a container hasn't relaunched after several minutes, if the MySQL or InfluxDB data is lost
or if a service has restarted badly (in particular ftps), the correction stops here.
